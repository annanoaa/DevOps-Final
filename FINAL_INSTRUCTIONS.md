# 🎯 Final Instructions for Your DevOps Project

## 🚨 Important: Docker Setup Required

The error you encountered indicates that Docker is not running on your system. Here's how to fix this:

### 1. Start Docker
```bash
# On macOS
open -a Docker

# On Linux
sudo systemctl start docker

# On Windows
# Start Docker Desktop from the Start menu
```

### 2. Verify Docker is Running
```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

## 🚀 Complete Project Setup

### Step 1: Start Docker and Run the Project
```bash
# 1. Start Docker (see above)
# 2. Run the project
./start.sh
```

### Step 2: Access Your Services
Once the script completes successfully, you can access:

- **Frontend Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5000
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3001 (admin/admin)
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090
- **cAdvisor**: http://localhost:8080

### Step 3: Run Security Scan
```bash
./scripts/security-scan.sh
```

### Step 4: Test Incident Simulation
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click on "Incident Simulation"
3. Try the different simulation buttons

## 📊 What You've Built

Your DevOps project now includes:

### ✅ Multi-Service Application
- **Frontend**: React.js with real-time monitoring dashboard
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express API with Prometheus metrics
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with sample data

EOF
```

### 3. Final Git Commit
```bash
# Add all files
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Complete DevOps Final Project with all requirements met"

# Optional: Create a tag
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Final project submission"
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Docker Won't Start
```bash
# macOS: Check Docker Desktop
open -a Docker

# Linux: Check Docker service
sudo systemctl status docker
sudo systemctl start docker

# Windows: Check Docker Desktop is running
```

### If Services Won't Start
```bash
# Check Docker is running
docker ps

# Check for port conflicts
lsof -i :3000
lsof -i :5000
lsof -i :3001
lsof -i :9090

# Restart services
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### If Security Scan Fails
```bash
# Install Trivy if not installed
# macOS
brew install trivy

# Linux
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/trivy/main/contrib/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin

# Windows
choco install trivy
```
